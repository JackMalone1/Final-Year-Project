          <h1>Board and game</h1>
          <p class="content">
            I set up the visualisation as well as the placement of the board using python and pygame. This was used to be
            able to display the board whenever the user picked different sizes of the board to be displayed. For palcing pieces
            I used the default collisions with pygame to set up collisions on each intersection and then check for key presses
            on them. The UI for the game was created by using an external library called Thorpy. This UI was then used to set
            up the board size as well as what algorithms to use as well as time alllocated.
            I created several helper classes as well as the base game to implement the rules of the game so that the game was
            able to keep track of what pieces were captured after a move as well as to keep track of what moves are legal. The
            Ai were then able to get all of their available moves from this rules class so that during evaluation they wouldn't
            accidentally try and play somewhere that they weren't able to such as somewhere that had no liberties.
            The pieces were set up to keep track of their positions on the board and then all of the pieces that were currently
            on the board was stored in the board class itself. The rules class was set up so that the AI would be able
            to use this data easily to keep track of what was happening in the game.

          <h1>Monte Carlo Tree Search</h1>
          <p class="content">
              The Monte Carlo Algorithm was set up to have a certain amount of time to be able to figure out a move. I set
              up the exploration so that it would try to go through as many moves as possible on the first move in the time
              allocated. It would then use the exploitation term to try and reduce the amount that it had to explore further
              into the move tree so that it would figure out as much as possible about the good moves as possible while
              ignoring the worse moves. There is a tradeoff between the two so it took some time to figure out what were
              good values for these terms to make sure that it exploited as much as possible while also exploring as to
              make sure that it won't miss a good move that might be bad until a few moves in the future.
              I also sett up some other functions so that it would keep track of how many moves that it searched through
              for each move so that this would be able to send to the jupyter notebook after each move. The algorithm
              used the rules class to find all of the available moves as well as to evaluate a board position to see how
              good a move is, this will be used to decide on whether or not to keep exploiting a move or if it should go
              and look at other moves that could be better.

          <h1>Alpha Beta MiniMax</h1>
          <p class="content">
              Minimax is a more traditional form of algorithm that has commonly been used to solve different board games.
              It is not as good for a game such ass Go as the search space is large. This is why I decided to use Alpha Beta
              MiniMax ass it can cut out a lot of moves that are not neccessary to check ass the other moves would not be played
              by the other player as they would not be the best move possible in the position.
              I set up the algorithm in the same way as the Monte arlo Tree search so that it would keep track of how many moves
              it calculated and only use a certain amount of time as to see how good the algorithms were in a tight time control.
              I will also be adding zobrist hashing into the algorithm as well as for Monte Carlo Tree Search so that instead
              of having to recalculate scores for games it will look it up in a database to see if it has already been done to
              hopefully save computing time so that Alpha Beta is able to go through more moves and hopefully be able to play
              on larger boards.

          <h1>Data Analytics and storing</h1>
          <p class="content">
            I set up a database using sqlite so that every time either of the AI made a move, it was stored with how many
            moves they were able to calculate as well as other information on the game in general. I also stored data
            at the end of each game about what ai was playing for each player in the game and how well each player did at the 
            end of the game. I was also able to use the explorer for sqlite to look at the database visually and also run 
            SQL as well when I needed to add in extra data or fix small problems in the data that I had Captured.
            For the data analytics, I used a Jupyter Notebook to analyse excel files that I generated through the database
            explorer which allowed me to convert the database files to csv files. These would be out into dataframes which I 
            was able to use pandas and MatplotLib to plot inside of the notebook. I also kept track of averages of the data
            that was captured inside of the game so that I was able to comapte how well each of the AIs were doing.
