                The problem domain that I have chosen for this project is to be able to have an Artificial Intelligence be able to play the game of go 
                or any other similar problem that requires the AI to search through a large search space to be able to figure out the best solution
                to the problem. 
                For this project, I would like to try and implement a version of Monte Carlo tree search such that I can create an AI that is able to efficiently
                solve a board state of the game of go. I would also like to test my application against a simpler algorithm such as MiniMax to compare how much
                quicker it is able to solve a position and against a stronger AI as well to see the difference between using it by itself as well with other
                algorithms that would help the tree search to find even better moves.

            <p class="content">
              Go is a two-player board game in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The game of go is
              usually played on a board that is 19x19 in size but can also be played on different sized smaller boards such as 9x9 or 13x13.
              For a 19x19 board, there is approximately 250 moves each turn that either player can play. If a game continues for 150 turns
              approximate turn count), then there would be 250 <span class="sup"><i>150</i></span> possible moves. Given the possible moves
              that each player can make per turn,
              it quickly becomes too much to be able to search through.
              If we use a game tree to describe how a normal game of go could develop,
              we would use the 250 possible moves as the branching factor(how many child nodes each current state has),
              and use the formula b <span class="sup"><i>d</i></span> where b is the branching factor and d is the required
              depth(how many moves deep we are in to the search)
              to find how many leaf nodes there are or how many different possible board states there could be.

          <h1 >Basics of Monte Carlo Tree Search</h1>
          <p class="content">
                In 2006, RÃ©mi Coulom described the application of the Monte Carlo method, which uses random sampling for deterministic problems which are
                difficult to solve with other approaches, to game-tree search and coined the term Monte Carlo tree search.
                Before this was used, go playing programs used different techniques that were more similar to those used in games such as chess 
                but are less suitable to the more complex game of go. Alpha-go was then introduced which uses two different neural networks which were able
                to beat world Go champion Lee Sedol in 2016 in South Korea with a lead of 4 games to 1. It was first introduced in October of 2015
                where it played its first match against European champion Fan Hui, with a score of 5-0. The documentary covering this story can be found
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&t=2855s">here</a>.

                Alpha go first learned how to play go by learning from amateur games so that it knew how human players thought about the game through supervised 
                learning. Alpha go was then retrained from games of self play through reinforcement learning which lead to the creation of Alpha zero.

                The number of possible games in go increases exponentially as the game goes on.
                For example, on move 1 there are 250 possible moves, by move 2 there are 62,500 and by move 10 there are 953,674,316,406,250,000,000,000 possible
                moves.
