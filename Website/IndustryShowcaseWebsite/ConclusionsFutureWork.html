          Monte Carlo Tree Search appears to be a good solution compared to the other more naive approaches to solving board games such as MiniMax
          while bing easier to implement than more in depth solutions such as Neural Networks. Monte Carlo Tree Search is able to search more moves than
          MiniMax even when MiniMax has improvements such as Alpha Beta to cut down on the number of different paths that the function has to evaluate.
          However, even with this improved speed, without extra help to improve its play such as an opening book or specific knowledge about certain patterns
          it will still have trouble with better opponents unless given a large amount of time to study the given position.
          Monte Carlo Tree Search is also able to scale up a lot better when given a much larger search space when I compared the two algorithms on the larger
          13x13 and 19x19 boards as Alpha Beta Minimax is too slow in this scenario to be able to evaluate the position correctly as it has to play out all 
          possible move states where as Monte Carlo Tree Search tries to only look at the best possible moves as much as possible. If both of these algorithms were
          given adequate information on opening ideas as well as different common positions that could arise in the game, I could see that Monte Carlo would still
          perform a lot better on the bigger boards but it would stay a bit more even on the smaller boards where Alpha Beta is able to search through a lot more
          of the available moves.

        <h1>Future Work</h1>
        <p class="content">
          There is still some room to add extra parts to both the Monte Carlo Tree Search as well as the Alpha Beta to try improve both their speed in finding
          a good move as well as how they evaluate positions. Zobrist Hashing could improve the speed for both of the algorithms as this could save a lot of time
          in terms of each of the algorithms re-evaluating previously seen positions. Zobrist hashing allows the algorithms to store a hash for a certain board 
          position along side the generated score for the position so that if it is encountered again you can use this score instead of having to re-evaluate. This
          can lead to problems in terms of figuring out a good hashing algorithm as to lead to as few collisions as possible, i.e. two different positions getting the
          same hash which could worsen the algorithms as they could misinterpret a position. How to store all of the different positions alongside their scores also
          needs to be taken into consideration as look up as well as inputing positions should be as fast as possible to make sure that this is faster than the regular
          algorithms while also making sure it does not use up too much memory.
          The algorithms could also be given more domain specific knowledge to try and give them a better edge in determining how to play certain positions as at
          the moment they may not notice common problems appearing on the board.
          I would also try to look into other parts of machine learning such as reinforcement learning to see how much a reinforcement learning model could improve
          the outputs of moves. This would require a lot more resources in order to train as well as to make sure works as intended, but hopefully once trained fully,
          would lead to better play than the other two approaches mentioned as it can train on a large amount of professional games whereas the other algorithms are
          just playing based on a custom evaluation function. This could also help with the algorithms not understanding different problems found on the board
          such as when certain pieces are alive as well as protecting their own pieces and territory better.
