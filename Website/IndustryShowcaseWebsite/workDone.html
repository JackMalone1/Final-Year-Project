            The problem domain that I have chosen for this project is to be able to have an Artificial Intelligence be able to play the game of go 
            or any other similar problem that requires the AI to search through a large search space to be able to figure out the best solution
            to the problem. 
            For this project, I would like to try and implement a version of Monte Carlo tree search such that I can create an AI that is able to efficiently
            solve a board state of the game of go. I would also like to test my application against a simpler algorithm such as MiniMax to compare how much
            quicker it is able to solve a position and against a stronger AI as well to see the difference between using it by itself as well with other
            algorithms that would help the tree search to find even better moves.
